# Cultist Recipe Hotkeys

This is a mod for Cultist Simulator that adds the ability to create hotkeys for "recipes" inside situation windows.
This allows you to hotkey a combination of cards in a situation, and immediately restore or start the combination at the press of a button.

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/RoboPhred/cultist-recipe-hotkeys/releases/).

## Usage

To store a recipe, open a situation window and arrange the cards how you want them.  Then, press Ctrl+F1 to Ctrl+F12 to save this combination.

When the situation is idle, you can press the corresponding function key to open the window and restore the cards to how you saved them.

If you want to immediately start the situation with your saved cards, hold Shift when pressing the function key.  This will populate the window
with the cards you specified and attempt to start the situation.  The window will open only if it is unsuccessful at starting.
Note that it may successfully start without all of the cards in place, if the recipe allows for it.  This is useful in cases such as Painting,
where not all of the "Art or Bread" cards are required.

At the moment, this mod does not support storing ongoing actions.  If your recipe requires additional cards to be added after starting, you
must add those cards yourself.


## Installation

This mod uses BepInEx 5.0.  You must install BepInEx to use this mod.

### Setting up BepInEx 5.0
You must use the [version 5.0 RC1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.0-RC1) or later, as earlier versions rely on Harmony.

Once you install BepInEx 5.0, you need to shut off harmony support, or no plugins will load.  To do this, edit `Cultist Simulator/BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg` and set `ApplyRuntimePatches` to false:
You may have to run Cultist Simulator once after installing BepInEx to generate the config file.
```
[Preloader]
ApplyRuntimePatches = false
```

### Installing the mod to BepInEx

Place the CultistRecipeHotkeys.dll file in `Cultist Sumulator/BepInEx/Plugins`

### Troubleshooting

If the mod isn't working, you can turn on the BepInEx logs to see what is going on.

Open your BepInEx config file at `Cultist Simulator/BepInEx/config/BepInEx.cfg` and enable the console by changing the `Enabled` key of `[Logging.Console]` to `true`.
```
[Logging.Console]
Enabled = true
```

Doing this will create a terminal window when you launch cultist simulator.  If you do not see this new window open, then BepInEx is probably not installed correctly,
or the config file is misconfigured.

Once you get the window, check its output after you hit the play button on the Cultist Simulator launcher.  You can either drag the terminal window to another
monitor, or tab out of Cultist Simulator to check it after launch.

If BepInEx is installed and configured properly, you should see messages similar to the following:
```
[Message:   BepInEx] BepInEx 5.0.0.0 RC1 - cultistsimulator
[Message:   BepInEx] Compiled in Unity v2018 mode
[Info   :   BepInEx] Running under Unity v2019.1.0.2698131
[Message:   BepInEx] Preloader started
[Info   :   BepInEx] 1 patcher plugin(s) loaded
[Info   :   BepInEx] Patching [UnityEngine.CoreModule] with [BepInEx.Chainloader]
[Message:   BepInEx] Preloader finished
```

If you do not see these messages, and your terminal window remains blank, then you probably forgot to turn off `AllowRuntimePatches`.  Read the section on Installing again.

Once you have confirmed BepInEx is installed properly, look for the mod loading message.  Once you start the game from the launcher, the terminal window should contain:
```
[Info   :   BepInEx] Loading [CultistRecipeHotkeys 0.0.1]
```
and
```
[Info   :CultistRecipeHotkeys] CultistRecipeHotkeys initialized.
```

If you do not see these lines, then the mod isn't in the correct folder.  Check the Installation instructions for details on where to put the mod.

If you have confirmed all of the above and still are having trouble, try looking at the terminal for lines starting with `[Error  :CultistRecipeHotkeys]`.  The mod will
try to log errors when it cannot do it's job properly.  Create a github issue with any CultistRecipeHotkeys error messages you find, and I will try to help you further.
